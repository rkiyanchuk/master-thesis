    abstract = {There are several recently proposed algorithms for solving the over
        defined MQ problem, two of them are XL represented by N. Courtois,
        A. Klimov, J. Patarin, A. Shamir in the article "Efficient Algorithms
            for solving Over defined System of Multivariate Polynomial Equations"
                and XSL represented by N. Courtois and J. Pieprzyk in "Cryptanalysis
                    of Block Cipher with Over defined System of Equations". There is
                    an opinion that these algorithms may be used as an attack on AES,
                       because AES can be represented as an over defined MQ problem. In
                           our research we constructed a new cipher called Baby Rijndael. It
                           is a scaled-down version of Rijndael with the same algebraic structure.
                           We apply the XL and XSL attacks on Baby Rijndael to see if it might
                           be possible to apply them on AES.},
